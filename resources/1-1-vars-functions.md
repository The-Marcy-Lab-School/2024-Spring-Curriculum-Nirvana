# Functions & Variables Key Concepts

## Declaration Types
| Declaration | hoisting | scope              | reassignment |
|-------------|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| `var`       | yes      | function or global | yes          |
| `let`       | no\*     | block              | yes          |
| `const`     | no\*     | block              | no           |

\* technically `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, so everyone says they just aren't hoisted

### What gets hoisted
The *declaration* is what gets hoisted, which means different things for functions and variables.

## Variables
```js
// What is written
1: console.log(name)
2:
3: var name = 'tim';
4:
```

```js
// JS essentially "hoists" things above even line 1
var name;
1: console.log(name)
2:
3: name = 'tim';
4:
```
And so `console.log` prints `undefined` becuase the *assignment* isn't hoised, only the *declaration*. This is dumb. It doesn't do what you think, but it also doesn't crash. This is why people never use `var` in 2020 and use `let` or `const` instead. We want bugs to be predictable so we can find them in development.

## Function Declarations
```javascript
// What is written
1: sayHi();
2:
3: function sayHi() {
4:   console.log('Hi!');
5: }
```
```js
// Notice the *entire* declaration is hoisted
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hi!');
}
1: sayHi();
2:
```
This code runs fine because the entire function is hoisted, so by line 1 it is already fully defined. Problems only come up if the function references outer variables that have not been defined yet:

```js
// this won't run becuase name isn't defined by line 1
1: sayHi();
2:
3: function sayHi() {
4:   console.log(`Hi ${name}!`);
5: }
6: let name = 'bob';
```

```js
// this will run but will incorrectly print 'Hi undefined!' becuase the value isn't hoisted with the variable declaration
1: sayHi();
2:
3: function sayHi() {
4:   console.log(`Hi ${person}!`);
5: }
6: var person = 'bob';
```
## Function Expressions
Also important to note, that `function declarations` are "fully" hoisted but `function expressions` are not. They only have their declaration hoisted, just like variables. This breaks things in most cases:

```js
1: sayHi();
2:
3: var sayHi = function() {
4:   console.log(`Hi ${person}!`);
5: }
```
The above won't work because this is what gets hoisted:
```js
var sayHi;
1: sayHi()
// BAD ALREADY
```
This will throw `TypeError: sayHi is not a function` becuase as of line 1, `sayHi` is not a function, but rather the primitive value `undefined`, which can't be called with `()`. This is why people again prefer function expressions over function declarations, it creates predictable errors when things are called *before* they are defined.

Of course, `let` and `const` expressions simply break because they aren't hoisted to begin with.

# Block vs Function Scope and Reaching up
`var` cares about function scoping, but not block scoping. `if...else` statements are block scoped, which means that `var` sees them as all one scope:

```js
if (Math.random() > .5) {
  var x = 2;
} else {
  var x = 3;
}

console.log(x)
```
This works just fine. But, this does not:

```js
function doIt() {
  if (Math.random() > .5) {
    var x = 2;
  } else {
    var x = 3;
  }
}

doIt();
console.log(x)
```
In order to fix this we have to take advantage of the fact that JS can reach up to higher scopes when looking for values.

```js
var x;
function doIt() {
  if (Math.random() > .5) {
    x = 2;
  } else {
    x = 3;
  }
}

doIt();
console.log(x)
```
By moving the declaration of the variable to the top scope, we can log it properly. And the lower, function scoped `x`'s can find the variable they refer to by reaching up to the top scope.

The same principle is required for `let` as well, since it IS block scoped:

```js
// BREAKS
if (Math.random() > .5) {
  let x = 2;
} else {
  let x = 3;
}

console.log(x)
```

```js
// FIXED
let x;
if (Math.random() > .5) {
  x = 2;
} else {
  x = 3;
}

console.log(x)
```

# Mutations and immutability
[My full article on types for more information](https://itnext.io/javascript-interview-prep-primitive-vs-reference-types-62eef165bec8?sk=dfe9e25c7edcf40e48fc96478afc2f1e)
| Data Type | *Primitive* or __Reference__|
|-----------|------------------------|
| Number    | *Primitive*            |
| String    | *Primitive*            |
| Boolean   | *Primitive*            |
| Undefined | *Primitive*            |
| Null      | *Primitive*            |
| Symbol    | *Primitive*            |
| Object    | __Reference__          |
| Array\*   | __Reference__          |

\* Arrays are technically objects, but people often act like they're different

(FYI symbols are [neat and new to JS](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-symbols/))

- "mutate" is a fancy way to say change or alter
- You can't mutate primitive data types
- You CAN mutate Reference types

## Pass by value
- Primitives data types pass only their value, they are not related to anything when used in assignments:

```js
let a = 1
let b = a
a += 1

// a is now 2
// b is still 1
```
Since primitive data types only pass their value, essentially what you've written is exactly the same as:

```js
let a = 1
let b = 1
a += 1
```
Which makes it immediately clear that `a` and `b` aren't actually related in any way.

## Pass by reference
Unlike primitives, which are defined as a simple value and call it a day, reference types actually only save a "pointer" or "reference" to an object stored elsewhere in memory. This means assignments actually DO link to each other:

```js
let car1 = { type: 'suv' };
let car2 = car1;
car1.type = 'hybrid';

console.log(car1.type);
console.log(car2.type);
// both log 'hybrid'
```
Both variables are pointing to the same object, a change in one means a change in both. If you want to "clone" an object, that is make an unrelated copy, you do things like use the spread operator:

```js
let car1 = { type: 'suv' };
let car2 = { ...car1 };
car1.type = 'hybrid';

console.log(car1.type); // hybrid
console.log(car2.type); // suv
```

# Side Effects
A side effect is what happens when a function alters something that isn't its return value. Here is an example where we want to congratulate a person on aging one year:

```js
const sayHappyBirthday = function(person) {
  person.age++;
  return `Congrats on turning ${person.age}, ${person.name}!`;
}

const tom = { name: 'tom', age: 20 };
console.log(sayHappyBirtday(tom));
```
While we do properly print `Congrats on turning 21, tom!`, that isn't *all* we're doing. No, we are permanently *mutating* tom's age, which is possible because we *passed by reference* the "tom" object. A dead giveaway that you have a side effect is that given the same arguments, the function will behave differently. In this case, if we call it again, the return value changes:

```js
const tom = { name: 'tom', age: 20 };
console.log(sayHappyBirtday(tom));
// congrats on turning 21, tom!
console.log(sayHappyBirtday(tom));
// congrats on turning 22, tom!
console.log(sayHappyBirtday(tom));
// congrats on turning 23, tom!
console.log(sayHappyBirtday(tom));
// congrats on turning 24, tom!
```
One of the easiest ways to avoid mutations is instead of passing by reference with an object, you simply pass by value with the individual pieces of primitive data:

```js
const sayHappyBirthday = function(oldAge, name) {
  oldAge++
  return `Congrats on turning ${oldAge}, ${name}!`;
}

const tom = { name: 'tom', age: 20 };
console.log(sayHappyBirthday(tom.age, tom.name));
console.log(sayHappyBirthday(tom.age, tom.name));
console.log(sayHappyBirthday(tom.age, tom.name));
console.log(sayHappyBirthday(tom.age, tom.name));
// all print 'congrats on turning 21, tom!'
```
By passing in the primitive age value *instead* of the object itself, when we reassign it with the ++ operator, nothing is actually changed on our original object. Remember, when we pass by value, nothing is actually linked. (by the way, it would be best in this case to simply ADD to the value instead of reassigning it, this was just a silly example)

When your function has no side effects, it is said to be a "pure" function. All that matters are the arguments that are passed in, and the return value is always predictable.

NOTE: sometimes you DO want to mutate an object, and that's fine! Just know what you are doing, and do it on purpose.

# Lexical Scope
There are 2 types of scope,
1. Static (or Lexical) Scope
2. Dynamic Scope

Both scopes refer to how a language can look for a variable value in higher scopes, but the difference is *when* the language looks for the value.

**Lexical Scope** assigns variable values based off how your code is written (lexical relating to the word textual). **Dynamic scope** assigns variables by looking where a piece code is *executed*. Lexical is also called Static because you can determine definitions by simply reading, while dynamic code *requires* the code to actually run.

Take the following example:

```js
function logX() {
  console.log(x)
}

const x = 1;
if (Math.random() > .5) {
  const x = 2;
  logX();
} else {
  const x = 3;
  logX();
}
```

Which `x` value will be logged, 1, 2, or 3? Well, Lexical Scoping is straightforward. Ask yourself, when you wrote `logX`, is there an `x` defined in the local function scope? No? Ok, check the scope above for an `x` declaration. Did you find one? Yes, `const x = 1`. Then that's the `x` that `logX` will ***always*** refer to. No matter what the random number evaluates to, `logX` does not care about any other `const x` assignments in the `if...else` blocks. It already found the value and called it a day. Lexical is determined at the time of *writing* the code.

That might be confusing without contrast, so let's look at Dynmaic Scope to clear it up. **REMEMBER THAT JS IS NOT DYNAMICALLY SCOPED**. With languages that are dynamically scoped (like BASH), programs must be run to determine assignments. That's becuase those languages look for values based on where the code is **executed**. So, if our random number was .6, then the `x` in `logX` would reach up from where it is called, not where it was defined. Meaning it would find `const x = 2`. But if our random number was something like .2, then reaching up would result in `const x = 3`. This is why you could never determine what the value is, becuase the program could go different ways every time it's run.

JS, like most modern languages, is NOT Dynmically Scoped because it renders unpredictable results. By being Lexically Scoped it makes problems like the one below simple:

```js
let name = 'Laisha';

function greet() {
  let name = `Paul`;
  console.log(`Hi ${name}!`);
}

greet();
console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
```
To determine what prints what, you just ask yourself, where is the nearest `name` defined when the code was *written*. on line 5, the nearest name is on line 4, so that's the one. And the final log, the nearest `name` is actually defined on line 1. That's because you can never reach *down* into a scope for a definition, you can only look in your current scope and above. By default, that leaves the only name in our current scope as the one defined on line 1.
